   b. Battles are Team vs. Team unless they are out of office. Remaining team member can take extra shots to compensate.

2.Scoring
   a. The Volley Ball Technique - One opponent is allowed 3 taps per shot to try and tap the ball into the goal for 0.5 points. Ball is dead after 3 taps / goal / touches a mostly horizontal surface (ie. ground/desk). Cannot force BP to play alone.
   b. Punished if you lose to a PERFECT from at least one opponent.

   c. Max N Dragon Ball(s) offered per fight, where N == Week #, Starting at 1 on Nov 20

4.Usable if alive, each player starts each week with:
   a. 2 Saves – Works like Rolando’s.
   b. 1 KS – Save that can kill. Optionally call “Kill Steal” to take the rewards of winning the fight from the rightful winner. Teams can chain KS’s.
 
5.Maritza
   If Maritza is hit or startled, every player in the current match gets on their knees (as much as possible), bows, and begs for forgiveness. 

6.Win Condition: Tournament of Power

   e. Defeat – The “Lead” team is knocked out. The remaining players fight until there are 2 players remaining, and award 1 Dragon Ball to each player. (If there is 1 player left their team gets both).

7. Rules can change at the start of the week.
